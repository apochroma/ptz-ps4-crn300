# Canon CR-N300 / PS4 Controller
This script is based on the work of Artur Spirin pyPS4Controller [https://github.com/ArturSpirin/pyPS4Controller](https://github.com/ArturSpirin/pyPS4Controller)

The script allows to control a Canon PTZ camera (model CR-N300) with a Playstation Game Controller (PS4).

## Autotracking
Since I see the possibilities to remote control the cameras programmatically, there is no stopping anymore :)
Just recently Canon announced a not free software feature for autotracking. Therefore I try to accomplish the autotracking with a "hack".
The python script autotracking.py. Have fun! Or watch my brief demonstartion here: [https://youtu.be/y_eZyY_mfr0](https://youtu.be/y_eZyY_mfr0)

*Not to be disappointed! I "only" use the data from meta.cgi which tracks the face(s) to focus them.
